# Enhancing-Breast-Cancer-Pre-screening-with-Deep-Learning-A-Non-Invasive-and-Scalable-Approach
This was the mini project I did in my 6th semester along with my teammate Varshini R under the guidance of Dr. A.Srilakshmi.

In this project, the traditional machine learning methods of XGBoost, LightGBM, Decision Tree, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression are compared against the deep learning method of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The results of the AUC Curve and confusion matrix show that Deep Learning is a better model for detection of breast cancer.
